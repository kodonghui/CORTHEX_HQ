### F1. 프로필 기본컷 (립싱크 메인)
Photorealistic portrait of a Korean woman, age 25, with an oval face shape, high cheekbones, soft jawline, and a small pointed chin. She has large almond-shaped double-eyelid eyes with dark brown irises, thin naturally arched eyebrows, a small straight nose with a defined bridge, and full lips with a natural rosy tint. Her skin is porcelain-fair with a healthy glow, no visible blemishes. Her hair is long, slightly past her shoulders, dark brown with warm chestnut balayage highlights, center-parted, with soft face-framing layers. She is wearing a white silk V-neck blouse with delicate fabric texture visible, and a thin 14k gold pendant necklace with a tiny cubic zirconia. Her makeup is minimal and natural: light foundation matching her skin tone, a thin line of brown eyeliner on the upper lid only, one coat of natural brown mascara, a subtle peachy-pink blush on the apples of her cheeks, and a MLBB (my lips but better) shade lip tint. She has a warm, genuine closed-mouth smile with slight dimples. She is looking directly into the camera. Shot from chest up, centered composition. Three-point studio lighting: key light at 45 degrees upper left with a large softbox creating soft shadows, fill light at lower right at half intensity, and a hair light from behind creating a subtle rim glow on her hair. Clean solid light warm gray background (#E8E4E0). Shot on Canon EOS R5, RF 85mm f/1.2L USM lens, aperture f/2.0, ISO 100, shallow depth of field with sharp focus on the eyes. Color grading: warm neutral tones, slight skin smoothing, natural color accuracy.

### F2. 업무 컷 (콘텐츠용)
Photorealistic editorial photograph of the same Korean woman from prompt 1, sitting at a modern minimalist desk in a high-rise apartment. She is wearing a fitted navy blue ribbed knit turtleneck sweater showing collarbone line, with small gold hoop earrings (15mm diameter). Her hair is pulled back in a low loose bun with a few wispy strands framing her face. On the desk: a MacBook Pro 16-inch with the screen showing a stock chart (screen slightly blurred), a single white ceramic mug with steam rising, and one small potted monstera plant in a matte white ceramic pot. She is resting her chin lightly on her right hand, elbow on the desk, looking at the camera with a composed, intelligent expression — slight smile, eyes engaged and confident. The desk is light oak wood with visible grain texture, clean with minimal items. Behind her: a floor-to-ceiling window showing a soft-focus daytime cityscape with natural overcast daylight streaming in from the left side. Interior colors: warm whites, light oak, touches of sage green from the plant. Camera angle: slightly above eye level, 3/4 body visible from waist up. Shot on Sony A7IV, 50mm f/1.4 GM lens, aperture f/2.8, natural window lighting supplemented by a bounce reflector on the right side filling shadows. Color grading: clean, bright, slightly desaturated warm tones with lifted shadows, modern editorial look.

### F3. 카페/일상 컷 (인스타 감성)
Photorealistic lifestyle photograph of the same Korean woman from prompt 1, standing in a bright modern cafe next to a large arched window. She is holding a tall glass iced latte with oat milk layering visible in the glass, held at chest height with both hands wrapped around it. She is wearing a cream-colored oversized cable-knit cardigan (slightly oversized, falling off one shoulder revealing a black thin-strap camisole underneath), light blue high-waisted straight-leg jeans visible at the waist. Her hair is down, natural and slightly wavy from air drying, tucked behind her left ear showing a small pearl stud earring. She is looking at the camera with a relaxed, friendly, approachable smile showing her top teeth slightly. The cafe interior: white marble tabletops, light wood bentwood chairs, hanging Edison bulb pendant lights slightly blurred in background, a small green trailing pothos plant on a shelf behind her. Warm golden afternoon sunlight streaming through the window creating soft directional lighting on her face with gentle shadows. Shot on Fujifilm X-T5, 56mm f/1.2 lens, aperture f/1.8, warm white balance (5800K). Color grading: warm golden tones, slightly lifted blacks, soft film-like grain, Instagram-editorial aesthetic.

### F4. 하늘하늘 치마 컷 (홍보/피드용)
Photorealistic portrait of a Korean woman, age 25, with an oval face shape, high cheekbones, soft jawline, and a small pointed chin. She has large almond-shaped double-eyelid eyes with dark brown irises, thin naturally arched eyebrows, a small straight nose with a defined bridge, and full lips with a natural rosy tint. Her skin is porcelain-fair with a healthy glow. Her hair is long, slightly past her shoulders, dark brown with warm chestnut balayage highlights, center-parted, with soft face-framing layers blowing slightly in a gentle breeze. She is wearing a light sky-blue flowy chiffon midi dress with thin spaghetti straps, the skirt portion flowing and billowing softly as if caught in a light wind, with delicate pleated fabric texture visible. She is also wearing a thin 14k gold pendant necklace and simple white leather strappy sandals. Her makeup is minimal and natural: light foundation, thin brown eyeliner, natural mascara, soft peachy-pink blush, and a MLBB lip tint. She is standing on a sunlit outdoor terrace with white stone railing, one hand lightly touching the railing, the other hand gently holding the side of her skirt as it flows in the breeze. She has a bright, warm smile showing her top teeth, looking directly at the camera. Full body shot from head to mid-calf, centered composition. Soft natural golden hour sunlight from the right side creating warm directional lighting with gentle shadows, backlit rim light on her hair and dress edges. Background: soft-focus greenery and a distant light-colored building, slightly overexposed for a dreamy airy feel. Shot on Canon EOS R5, RF 85mm f/1.2L USM lens, aperture f/2.0, ISO 100. Color grading: warm, bright, airy tones with lifted shadows, soft pastel color palette, clean and feminine editorial aesthetic.

## 남성

### M1. 프로필 기본컷 (립싱크 메인)
Photorealistic portrait of a Korean man, age 28, with a defined angular face shape, strong straight jawline, and prominent cheekbones. He has sharp monolid eyes with dark brown-black irises and an intense but warm gaze, straight thick eyebrows with a clean natural shape, a straight nose with a slightly high bridge, and medium-width lips with a natural muted pink tone. His skin is a light warm beige tone with smooth texture and a matte finish, slight natural shadow under the cheekbones. His hair is short-medium length, jet black, styled in a textured comma hairstyle with volume at the top and sides tapered neatly. He has no facial hair, clean-shaven with a sharp jawline visible. He is wearing a perfectly fitted charcoal gray merino wool crew-neck sweater with fine knit texture visible, over a white collared shirt with just the collar tips showing at the neckline. He has a calm, self-assured expression with a very subtle closed-mouth smile — confident but approachable, like a young startup CEO. He is looking directly into the camera. Shot from chest up, centered composition. Three-point studio lighting: key light at 45 degrees upper right with an octagonal softbox for slightly more contrast than female portrait, fill light at left at one-third intensity for more defined shadows, and a rim light from behind-left creating a subtle edge glow. Clean solid medium gray background (#D0CCC8). Shot on Canon EOS R5, RF 85mm f/1.2L USM lens, aperture f/2.0, ISO 100, tack-sharp focus on the eyes with smooth bokeh falloff on shoulders. Color grading: cool-neutral tones, natural contrast, no skin smoothing, sharp and editorial.

### M2. 업무 컷 (콘텐츠용)
Photorealistic editorial photograph of the same Korean man from prompt 1, sitting in a modern executive-style co-working space. He is wearing a crisp white oxford button-down shirt with sleeves rolled up twice to mid-forearm showing a minimal silver watch (thin case, leather strap) on his left wrist. His hair is the same comma style but slightly more relaxed. He is sitting in a dark charcoal Herman Miller style mesh office chair, leaned slightly forward with both hands on the desk, fingers interlaced, looking at the camera with a direct confident expression — serious but not intimidating, like he is about to explain something important. On the desk: a 27-inch monitor showing financial data (blurred), a wireless mechanical keyboard, a single black leather notebook closed with a silver pen on top. The workspace: dark walnut desk surface, concrete accent wall behind him with a single framed abstract print (navy and gold tones), a slim black desk lamp providing warm accent light. Overhead recessed lighting providing even ambient illumination, supplemented by the warm desk lamp creating a pool of warm light from the left. Camera angle: eye level, upper body visible from waist up, slight 3/4 angle (turned 15 degrees to his left). Shot on Sony A7IV, 35mm f/1.4 GM lens, aperture f/2.8. Color grading: moody, modern, slightly cool shadows with warm highlights, cinematic contrast, corporate editorial feel.

### M3. 카페/일상 컷 (인스타 감성)
Photorealistic lifestyle photograph of the same Korean man from prompt 1, leaning casually against a floor-to-ceiling window frame in a minimalist loft-style space. He is wearing a black fitted turtleneck long-sleeve shirt tucked into dark navy tailored chinos with a brown leather belt, and he is holding a hardcover book in one hand (spine facing camera, no readable text needed) loosely at his side. He has slim rectangular silver-framed glasses perched on his nose. His hair is slightly less styled, more natural and soft. His expression is thoughtful and reflective — looking slightly past the camera to the upper left with a gentle closed-mouth half-smile, as if he just thought of something interesting. The space: polished concrete floor, exposed brick wall section to his right, a single large monstera deliciosa plant in a matte black ceramic floor pot nearby. Late afternoon golden hour sunlight flooding through the window behind him, creating strong warm backlight and a lens flare effect, with his face lit by soft reflected fill light bouncing off the white wall opposite the window. Shot on Fujifilm X-T5, 56mm f/1.2 lens, aperture f/1.4, focus on his face with dreamy bokeh on the background. Color grading: warm golden hour tones, rich amber highlights, slightly desaturated shadows, cinematic film emulation with soft grain.
